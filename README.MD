Todo-App

This app makes it easy for you to track things you need to do. The app launches as a console application but with focus to be easy navigated.

You can create a project containing several subtasks or simple create a task that needs to be done on a specific date.
All tasks and projects will be stored locally on your computer. Once all tasks in a project is completed, the project will be removed next time the app launches.
