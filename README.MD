Todo-App

This app makes it easy for you to track things you need to do. The app launches as a console application but with focus to be easy navigated.

You can create a project containing several subtasks, a task that needs to be done on a specific date or a task that occur once in a week.
All tasks and projects will be stored locally on your computer.
